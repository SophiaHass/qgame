ESCAPE THE GRUE

The mad king has decided that you are superfluous to his kingdom, and has ordered you to be thrown into the palace dungeon.

This dungeon harbours the slavering grue; a tyrannical beast, almost invincible, and very, very hungry.

Your only hope is in the rumour that you have heard -- that somewhere in the dungeon lies a copy of the key to the door you 
came in through. With it, you could escape.

ESCAPE THE GRUE is intended to be a difficult game. Many aspects of the game are randomised, and even the most 
savvy players will lose more rounds than they win.

The titular grue has a powerful sense of smell and will slowly hone in on your location. Keep moving! And remember,
discretion is the better part of valour!

You start out with a rusty sword and a smoke bomb. When used in a fight, the smoke bomb makes it possible to escape an enemy
encounter without fail. I suggest you use it.
